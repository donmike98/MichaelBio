    <p>Iâ€™m currently studying at University of Northampton. I am a reliable, hardworking student who always completes the tasks that have been set and look on to extensions. I work to the best of my ability and even push myself for harder goals. I would
        bring good communication and organization skills as well as great customer service skills to a position. I also work particularly well in a team as well as independently with an enthusiastic and friendly personality with good interpersonal skills,
        coupled with the ability to work under pressure. Computers have developed my problem solving skills as I always like trying out new things and trying to improve them.
