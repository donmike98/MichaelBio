    <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>My name is Michael if you didn't already know and I'm car enthusiast. In my spare time I attends car shows. Also, I'm big on the
    football team chealsea. I went to my first game when I was 9 years old and has supported them ever since. Naturally growing up in
     the area I live in football is picked up as the main way to pass free time. As a child the closest to driving a car was through
    go-karting, this was really fun and I would spend hours with mates going through all the different tracks.</p>
     <p2>I have always had a competitive side to me aswell due to the hobbies I take part in m spare time. The other side to me is I also
   like to complete puzzles, crosswords and soduko as I believe these activities help to keep the brain active as well as give me good
   alone time.    </p2>
